# valheim
The alternative to Valheim server state sharing you all have been waiting for!

## Usage

```bash
$ git clone git@github.com:steebe/valheim.git
$ cd valheim
$ ./copy-to-worlds.sh <WINDOWS_USERNAME>
```

The above will make a backup of your existing _worlds_ state, which contains **all** of your Valheim saves, and then create a new or overwrite the existing `TheTommune` server world.
